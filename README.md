# Module12Challenge
The task is to create a Jupyter notebook that contains the data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company(MercadoLibre) needs to understand.

# Technologies
- python 3.9.13
- JupyterLab
- libraries: pandas, pathlib, numpy, sklearn, imblearn
- MacOs
# Installation
If you want to run the program yourself and/or enter different data, do the following:
1. To install the project files, go to the GitHub page for the workshop, click on the green Code button, then download the repository as a ZIP file.

</br>
2. Unpack a zip file into the directory you can operate from in JupyterLab.

3. Install all the libraries via Terminal, open credit_risk_resampling.ipynb and Run the code!

## Overview of the Analysis

* Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. The task was to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* We used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, and what you needed to predict. </br>

We used the logistic regression model, that predicts both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) classes.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
